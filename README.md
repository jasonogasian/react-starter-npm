# react-starter-npm

## Notes:

* This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
* [Advanced Configuration](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#advanced-configuration)
* It includes a [SASS preprocessor](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-css-preprocessor-sass-less-etc)
  * Note that node-sass seems to have an issue recognizing newly created files on some systems so you might need to restart the watcher when you create a file until itâ€™s resolved.
